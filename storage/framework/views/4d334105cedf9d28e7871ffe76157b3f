			<h2>Programming</h2>
			<p>
				In this section of the site you can find usefull (or useless) informations and source code. I have written a good amount of programmes in C since 2003 when i started studying the language but sadly i don't have all of them. In fact i have only the two latest programmes that i wrote when i tried to be involved with SDL libraries.
			</p>
			<h2>C/C++</h2>
			<p>Here are software written in C or C++</p>
			<h3>TicTacToe</h3>
			<p>
				TicTacToe is one of the most famous games in the world. It was my first try with SDL libraries. The game has no sound and a lousy A.I.. I won't be invlovled again with this game anymore, so don't wait for updates.

			<h3>arcanoidX</h3>
			<p>
				ArcanoidX is a clone of another famous game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid">arcanoid</a>(duh!). The game has no sound yet and only four levels but i will add sound and more levels soon. I update the game sporadicaly.
